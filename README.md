# tlvdb

A TLV and file-based database implementation in Python

## Intro
### Why?

Have you ever asked how difficult is to implement a database? 
What are the trade-offs? Why isn't a database out there that fits all?

Well... I did, so I am giving it a try

### Who is this project for?

I think that 'd be only me... but in general any developer that wants to 
implement a custom database might find it a good starting point

## The basics

The main features are:

- TLV implemenation based on `struck` python module
- Binary file for storing
- Hash index for items in the storage
